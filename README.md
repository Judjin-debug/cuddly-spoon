# React GET request app

This little React app fetches user, comment and post data from jsonplaceholder.typicode.com. There are three buttons to fetch each kind of data individually. Each of the buttons triggers useEffect hook to make a fetch request, which uses the trigger string data to mutate the request link. Then, by using React jsx components, the fetched JSON data is displayed in form of a table below the button bar. Each table cell gets a unique hash ID using uuid package.
